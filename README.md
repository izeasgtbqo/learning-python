# learning-python

Today I decided to learn Python. I decided to re-learn to code, and learn to write at the same time. So why Python?

It looks independent (nothing like .Net or Java, or Go), people seem to love it, so let's try.

So yes, it is popular. 

So how do I start coding Python? I will use VS code. Maybe even Visual Studio Codespaces in the future:

oh, I already have it on my computer, lucky me... How to start with Python on VS Code? This looks like a nice place to start:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

ctrl+shift p to open the command pallette on VS Code to install Python Module (which is also already installed on my computer, how lucky)

Now I need the actual Python Interpreter. Open up the shiny new Windows Terminal and type "python" which opens up the Microsoft Store, how convenient. Python 3.8 is a 38 MB install. 

Aaaaand, VS Code froze. I didn't like this Microsoft Store installation as I can't find the path on my computer. Let's do this the old way:

Back to the tutorial a few steps back. Two typos in a two line Hello World sample. Well done. Anyway, it works. So what the hell is a Linter?

OK, so basically it looks to my code and whines. Luckily VS Code does it automatically.

The tutorial is done, and at the moment I don't want to try Flask or Django at all. I am set for the day...
